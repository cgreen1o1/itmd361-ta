        <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
        <p>One of the things I enjoy most are the fun aspects of science and
          technology. Although I am unfortunately not the smartest or most
          technologically-advanced individual, I like to appear that I know more than
          I actually do. I've found some entertaining videos and merchandise that help
          "make fun" of science. For all my fellow "Geeks" visit the website <a
          href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">thinkgeek.com</a> for a lot of "nerdy"
          (mostly) useful items.

          <h2 class="title">Common Ground with Others</h2>
            <p>I find it so interesting to discover that I share common
            interests or experiences with fellow classmates. From being in the
            course ITMD 361 for the Fall 2017 semester and interacting with the
            other students, I have been able to learn more about them and am
            excited to find out a lot of similarities amongst us. A few
            examples:</p>
            <ul id="common">
              <li><a
              href="https://robertlebeau.github.io/cssproject/interests/">Robert
              LeBeau</a> and I have both played water polo</li>
              <li>I live in the same area as <a
