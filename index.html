        <p>One of the things I enjoy most are the fun aspects of science and
          technology. Although I am unfortunately not the smartest or most
          technologically-advanced individual, I like to appear that I know more than
          I actually do. I've found some entertaining videos and merchandise that help
          "make fun" of science. For all my fellow "Geeks" visit the website <a
          href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">thinkgeek.com</a> for a lot of "nerdy"
          (mostly) useful items.

        <p>I find it so interesting to discover that I share common
          interests or experiences with fellow classmates. From being in the
          course ITMD 361 for the Fall 2017 semester and interacting with the
          other students, I have been able to learn more about them and am
          excited to find out a lot of similarities amongst us. A few
          examples:</p>
